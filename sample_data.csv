88,87,jij0jqx,2023-05-12,"So basically you will need to understand the framework is needed for your mobile application and backend

So depending on your project and the idea and 
You need to know the following answers or those questions

My best advice
Have a design(figma-zeplin) ready before you do anything
Make sure they are detailed 
Like showing success - error dailog
Popups and so
It will save you so much time and money 
And gives you the results you want

What is the expected performance?
Are you expecting heavy usage and traffic or is it something just to start with and then scale accordingly?
Do you need some extremely fast and mutli threaded for backend




What type of applications
If it is a game 
Go straight to unity framework 

For example there are frameworks like react native and flutter 
That are very useful in building mobile application
Where one code is used for both iOS and Android 
But they have their limitations.
So depending on your app and what is expected will those framework be sufficient for you
(Example image and video editting app)

You most definitely will need it to be native or at at least have some kind of native background multithread code to handle the amount of processing



Note changing your framework(mobile application)while in working just means throwing the work out 

Usually speaking
React native or flutter are usually enough to start with
But if you are looking for the best possible performance then you go native
(Performance will depend mostly on the developer though)


Important notes 
Slack is probably the go to tools
Also you need a repo and keep the code
And you will also need to decide on your hosting
Like AWS azure also email provider sms provider
Ip checker based on location provider


Edit:
If has an subscriptions or in app purchases

You must use the provided services from Google and apple for that and they will take 30%

Any other payments in the app you will need a service provider (physical goods and services)

Like stripe",So basically you will need to understand the framework is needed for your mobile application and backend So depending on your project and the idea and You need to know the following answers or those questions My best advice Have a design(figmazeplin) ready before you do anything Make sure they are detailed Like showing success - error dailog Popups and so It will save you so much time and money And gives you the results you want What is the expected performance?
